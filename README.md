# Ye olde Trials simulation engine

INSTRUCTIONS: Look up your Trials win rate on destinytracker.com and pass it in below. Maybe look at your seasonal win rate, and also your win rate in recent weekends, as they may be different. If your laptop is a potato, pick a relatively low number of games, like 100000.

Usage: tribulations [options]

    -t, --type [TYPE]                The passage type to simulate (mercy, ferocity, persistence, all)

    -w, --win-rate [PERCENTAGE]      The percentage of games to simulate winning
