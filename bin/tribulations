    Ye olde Trials simulation engine

    INSTRUCTIONS: Look up your Trials win rate on destinytracker.com and pass
    it in below. Maybe look at your seasonal win rate, and also your win rate
    in recent weekends, as they may be different. If your laptop is a potato,
    pick a relatively low number of games, like 100000.

    Usage: tribulations [options]

  USAGE

  opts.on("-t", "--type [TYPE]", [:mercy, :ferocity, :persistence, :all], "The passage type to simulate (mercy, ferocity, persistence, all)") do |t|
    options[:type] = t
  end

  opts.on("-n", "--num-games [COUNT]", Integer, "The number of games to simulate (defaults to 10 million)") do |n|
    options[:games] = n
  end

  opts.on("-w", "--win-rate [PERCENTAGE]", Integer, "The percentage of games to simulate winning") do |w|
    if w < 0 || w > 100
      abort("You can't have a percentage less than 0 or greater than 100!")
    end
    options[:win_rate] = w
  end
end.parse!
